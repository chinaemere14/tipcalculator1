Hello! I'm Chinaemere Ike. I am a sophomore Computer Science & Political Science major at Texas A&M University. 

The following **required** functionality is complete:
* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [X] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

This was my first time using XCode and Swift. It was difficult for me, due to I was balancing a lot of other things, I ran into virtual machine problems which I had to restart this project a few days ago. I wish I could have done better but nevertheless, this was such an amazing yet challenging experience for me! I plan on contniuing to learn iOS development/Swift post this assignment.
